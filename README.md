#Version 1.0.0
//DRY code 

#New Release Notes - Version 1.1.0
#Issues Resolved
1. Code Simplification

Issue: The previous version of the app contained several instances of duplicated code, leading to a violation of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This made the codebase harder to maintain and understand.

Resolution:

    Refactored the code by introducing reusable functions to encapsulate common logic.
    Created utility functions for repetitive tasks, such as data formatting and widget creation, which reduced code duplication and improved readability.
    
2. Rotation Handling

Issue: The app did not properly handle orientation changes, causing layout issues when switching between portrait and landscape modes. This resulted in a poor user experience, as some widgets were not displayed correctly.

Resolution:

    Implemented responsive design principles to ensure that the app's layout adapts seamlessly to both portrait and landscape orientations.
    Utilized MediaQuery to determine the current orientation and adjust widget sizes and arrangements accordingly.
